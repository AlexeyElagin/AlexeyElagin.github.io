I had pleasure to teach at the [Independent University of Moscow](https://mccme.ru/en/nmu/) - a small independent university aimed at teaching maths on high level with unique atmosphere.

Here are the lecture courses that I composed, organised and led:
- Algebra — 1,2,3 (2010-2011, 2017-2018)
- Commutative algebra (Fall 2013)
- Introduction to algebraic geometry (Fall 2014)
- Homological algebra (Fall 2010, Spring 2016)
- Homological methods in representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras — 1,2 (Fall 2020/Fall 2021)
