In Sheffield, I am teaching the following courses:
- MAS2006 Group Theory (Spring 2026), lecture course
- MPS234 Mathematics Core II (Fall 2025), problem sessions
- ELE225 Systems Engineering Mathematics II (Fall 2025), problem sessions


Earlier, I had pleasure to teach at the [Independent University of Moscow](https://mccme.ru/en/nmu/) -- a small independent university aimed at teaching maths on high level with unique atmosphere.

Here are the lecture courses that I composed, organised, and led:
- Algebra--1 (Fall 2010, Fall 2017)
- Algebra--2 (Spring 2011, Spring 2018)
- Algebra--3 (Fall 2011, Fall 2018)
- Homological algebra (Fall 2010, Spring 2016)
- Commutative algebra (Fall 2013)
- Introduction to algebraic geometry (Fall 2014)
- Homological methods in representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras--1 (Fall 2020)
- Homological methods in representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras--2 (Fall 2021)
