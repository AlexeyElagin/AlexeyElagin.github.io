I am a mathematician, which means that my job is to describe the laws of nature in the language of mathematics. More concretely, I am interested in algebraic geometry and categories, especially --- in categories arising in algebraic geometry, like derived categories of coherent sheaves. I like to think about:
- the structure of derived categories, via semi-orthogonal decompositions and exceptional collections, and invariants of these categories
- their relation to birational geometry and rationality questions
- representations of finite-dimensional algebras and triangulated categories emerging there
- what happens if there is a group action
- ...


Currently (since Oct 2024) I am a research associate (aka postdoc) at the [University of Sheffield](https://agmp.sites.sheffield.ac.uk). 
Before that I was working at the [University of Edinburgh](https://maths.ed.ac.uk) under a fellowship from Isaac Newton Institute, 
and prior to that I was (rather parallel than successively):
- working as a research fellow at IITP (Kharkevich Institute) and [HSE](https://ag.hse.ru/en/) (Higher School of Economics)
- reading lectures at [IUM](https://mccme.ru/en/nmu/) (Independent University of Moscow)
- teaching maths at [57th School](https://sch57.ru/index.en.html)
- writing my thesis at [Steklov Institute](https://www.mi-ras.ru/?l=1) under the supervision by Dmitri Orlov,
all in Moscow.
